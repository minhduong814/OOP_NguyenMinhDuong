Question

1. What class should implement the Comparable interface?
- The Media class should be implemented that inherited classes get the Comparison methods

2. In those classes, how should you implement the compareTo() method be to reflect the ordering that we want?
- Depends on the specific ordering criteria. In the demonstration above, it uses chained comparison logic.

3. Can we have two ordering rules of the item (by title then cost and by cost then title) if we use this Comparable interface approach?
- No, the interface approach only allows a single ordering rule within a class.

4. Suppose the DVDs has a different ordering rule from the other media types, that is by title, then decreasing length, then cost. How would you modify your code to allow this?
- Overriding compareTo() method to allow different ordering rules
